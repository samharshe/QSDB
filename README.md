# QSDB

I need to do a better job tracking my training, recovery, and supplementation, but there are no tools that exist that I want to use.  
I want to own my data, I want full customizability, and I want things stored in a format that I am confident will allow me to see my old records forever.
I also want to learn to use SQL better.  

So, I am building this database to keep track of a bunch of data about myself. I am hoping that this architecture is flexible enough that I only have to modify this project in the future, and never restart it. I am also hoping that recording all this data is worth the time, and that this database helps me discover things about myself and my behavior. We'll see.
