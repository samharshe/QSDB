# QSDB

I need to do a better job tracking my training, recovery, and supplementation, but there are no tools that exist that I want to use.  
I want to own my data, I want full customizability, and I want things stored in a format that I am confident will allow me to see my old records as far down the line as I want.  
I also want to learn to use SQL better.  

So, I am building this database to keep track of all the data about myself that I want to. I am hoping that I can construct it flexibly enough that I only modify this project, and never restart it. I am also hoping that this proves genuinely useful and that I can find interesting things out about myself for having saved all this data. We'll see.
